## 1. Introduction

This project aims at creating a website for a bank and its customers.

There will also be an “Account Details” page that will be shown after the customer logs in, showcasing the customer’s current bank accounts and respective balances. Furthermore, there will be an “Account Statements” page that shows all transactions made on a specific bank account. Finally, a “Transfers” page will allow the customer to deposit and withdraw money to and from accounts.
