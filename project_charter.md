## 1. Introduction

This project aims at creating a website for a bank and its customers. This will include a “Registration” page that allows customers to create a new account and a “Home” page that allows customers to log into the website. There will also be an “Account Details” page that will be shown after the customer logs in, showcasing the customer’s current bank accounts and respective balances. Furthermore, there will be an “Account Statements” page that shows all transactions made on a specific bank account. Finally, a “Transfers” page will allow the customer to deposit and withdraw money to and from accounts.

## 5. Risks, Assumptions, and Constraints

### 5.1 Risks
- Group members may decide to drop out of the course in the near future.
- When making transactions, the system may not round the amount properly, resulting in users transferring more or less money than intended.
- Contracted services may go down, resulting in users being unable to transfer funds to another individual.
- The website is temporarily down for an extended period of time due to hosting and domain maintenance.
- Customers may have trouble navigating through the website due to complex UI/UX.

### 5.2 Assumptions
- Group members will stay throughout the entire course.
- Group members will adhere to best practices and will communicate effectively with one another.
- Contracted services used by our website continue to operate.
- The world doesn’t blow up.

### 5.3 Constraints
- Unable to undo a transfer to another individual after 72 hours; a contract service is responsible for the transaction, therefore the bank itself cannot revert the transaction.
