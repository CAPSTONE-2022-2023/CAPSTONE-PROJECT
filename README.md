# Group 21 - Bank Website

<p>
  This project aims at creating a bank website. With this website, it will have functionality such as creating and editing user accounts, making deposits and withdrawls, displaying account transactions, and transferring funds from one account to another. Every new account created will have an ID associate with them, generated by the system. Because of the functionality listed above (alongside more that hasn't been listed), we will need to implement a Homepage, a Login Page, and a Logout Page, alongside a few more pages. 

This wesite will be created using MongoDB at its back-end. At its front end, the frameworks that we plan on using are Node.js and React for its front-end.
