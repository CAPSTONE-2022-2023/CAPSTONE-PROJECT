  - Comment and document every line of code you write that isn’t explicitly self-explanatory.
  - Commit to agreed upon naming conventions for variables and functions.
  - Each function should only do one thing.
  - No magic numbers.

**Tean Meetings**
<br/>Every Tuesday, the entire team will meet up for 30 minutes and discuss progress, issues, and any questions. All meetings are to be recorded.

- They are also obligated to buy the other team members lunch.
- Any team member that misses three (3) consecutive meetings will be reported to the professor.

**Team Commitment**
<br/>The undersigned members agree to work together on the project until the end of the BTS630 next Semester. They recognize as a team and individually that they are responsible for the quality of all deliverables.
